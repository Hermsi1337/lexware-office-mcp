# AGENTS.md

## Project Purpose

This repository contains a Go-based MCP server for the Lexware Office public API. The project goal is to provide a maintainable, extensible bridge between MCP clients and Lexware resources such as contacts, articles, invoices, vouchers, files, and related accounting workflows.

Primary external reference:

- Lexware API documentation: https://developers.lexware.io/docs/

## Mandatory Repository Language

All repository-facing content must be written in English.

This rule applies to:

- source code comments
- commit messages
- pull request titles and descriptions
- README content
- AGENTS/CLAUDE guidance files
- issue text added by agents
- generated docs and examples
- test names when readable prose is involved

User prompts may be in German or another language, but the repository output must remain English unless the user explicitly requests a non-English artifact for product reasons.

## Working Agreement For Agents

- Preserve the existing Go codebase and extend it incrementally.
- Prefer small, composable changes over broad rewrites.
- Keep the server usable as an MVP even while dedicated endpoint wrappers are still incomplete.
- Favor typed MCP tools where the schema is stable and valuable.
- Do not add generic raw passthrough MCP tools. This repository should expose typed requests and typed responses only.
- Respect Lexware API limits and keep rate limiting or retry behavior explicit in code.
- Prefer official Lexware API behavior over assumptions; verify unclear details against the official documentation.

## Documentation Requirements

Before every commit, ensure both of these files are up to date with the current implementation:

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

If the code changes behavior, setup, scope, supported tools, constraints, or conventions, update the documentation in the same change before committing.

## Project Layout

The repository follows the [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) convention:

- `cmd/lexware-office-mcp/main.go`: application entrypoint
- `internal/lexware/config.go`: environment-based configuration loading
- `internal/lexware/client.go`: authenticated Lexware HTTP client built on resty with 429 retry handling
- `internal/server/server.go`: MCP server setup and tool registration
- `build/goreleaser/.goreleaser.yml`: GoReleaser configuration for multi-platform releases
- `build/package/docker/`: Dockerfiles for container image builds
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow triggered by version tags

## Current MVP Tool Surface

The repository currently exposes these MCP tools:

- `lexware_get_profile`
- `lexware_create_simple_contact`
- `lexware_create_invoice`

When adding or removing tools, update `README.md` and this file before committing.

## Preferred Next Steps

- Add dedicated invoice operations beyond single-invoice retrieval
- Add typed voucher and file workflows
- Improve endpoint-specific request and response typing
- Add tests for config loading, client behavior, and MCP tool handlers
- Consider better error mapping and retry strategy for Lexware API failures

## Release Process

Releases are managed by [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) and triggered by pushing a git tag matching `v*`:

1. Tag a commit: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`
2. GitHub Actions builds multi-platform binaries (linux/darwin/windows, amd64/arm64)
3. Multi-arch Docker images are pushed to `ghcr.io/hermsi1337/lexware-office-mcp`
4. A GitHub Release is created with binaries and checksums

Local testing via Docker (no GoReleaser install needed):

- `make release-check` -- validate config
- `make release-snapshot` -- build without publishing

## Commit Hygiene

- Keep commits focused and readable.
- Use English commit messages.
- Do not commit local workspace artifacts such as `.codex`, `.gocache`, `.gomodcache`, or IDE metadata.
- Keep `.gitignore` current when new local-only files appear.

## CLAUDE.md

`CLAUDE.md` should remain a symlink to `AGENTS.md` so tools and coding agents that look for either file receive the same repository guidance.
